You can use these commands through stdin:
- crash <process_id> -- crashes the process, resetting all transient state
- sleep <process_id> <reply_to_clients> -- process does not react raft-only/all messages, but does not drop them either
- awake <process_id> -- react to messages and replay the missed messages
- append <process_id> <value> ?<id>? -- attempt to append value to the log, optionally specifying the id
- unstable <process_id> -- weak read of the current state
- stable <process_id> -- consistent read of the current state

You can run it with `sbt "run <process_number>"`
You can reset the persistent storage with `rm -rf persistent-state`
In addition to stdout, more logs appear in `raft.log`
