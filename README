The Guardian is acting as a proxy for the sake of simplicity. That is, all Raft processes assume they only ever talk to one Guardian process.
I recognize this is a loss of generality but it's an easy extension that I did not need so far, and chose to keep the code simpler instead.

You can use these commands through stdin:
- crash <process_id> -- crashes the process, resetting all transient state
- sleep <process_id> <seconds> -- process does not react to any messages for <seconds> seconds, but does not drop them either
- append <process_id> <value> -- attempt to append value to the log
- read <process_id> -- read the current state machine state (default machine returns the last written value)

You can run it with `sbt "run <process_number>"`
You can reset the persistent storage with `rm -rf persistent-state`
In addition to stdout, more logs appear in `raft.log`
